# Contributing to Mnema

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Mnema. This project is part of *The Authentic Rebellion*, and by contributing, you are helping to build a future where technology respects human dignity and privacy.

## How Can I Help?

### 1. The Core (Rust)
We are building a high-performance backend. If you know **Rust**, we need help with:
* Interfacing with Windows APIs for low-latency screen capture.
* Integrating the ONNX Runtime for hardware-accelerated inference.
* Managing the embedded LanceDB instance.

### 2. The Interface (Frontend/Scripting)
We want the UI to be "hackable." If you are a scripter or frontend dev:
* Help us design the API that allows users to write their own overlays.
* Create default themes and widgets.

### 3. Documentation
Documentation is a first-class citizen here. We need:
* Tutorials for end-users on how to script their own UI.
* Clear architectural diagrams for the Rust backend.

## Development Workflow

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a branch** for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
3.  **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`).
4.  **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`).
5.  **Open a Pull Request.**

## Style Guidelines

* **Rust:** We use `rustfmt` and `clippy`. Please ensure your code passes both before submitting.
* **JavaScript:** Keep it clean and readable. We prioritize readability over cleverness.

## Community Standards

We are building a tool for introspection and growth. We expect all contributors to treat each other with respect, patience, and empathy.
